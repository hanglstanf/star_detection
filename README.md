# star_detection
This is our EE368 final project \n
Clone to your PC: 
git clone https://github.com/suyao/star_detection.git
Useful commands:
for example, after you add a file called star.m
>git add star.m
>git commit -m 'a commit msg you would like to address for your modifications, making this meaningful would help others and you to look back at the past work'
>git push

'git status' is always a helpful command to type in to check before commiting to the master whether you have added/commited all of your local changes
'git history' allows you to go back to any commited version
